# Entrepreneurial Lens (CS 5092)

This practicum helps students develop their ability to imagine and recognize startup ideas. 

In each session, students learn about a different approach to startup and product ideation, then practice that approach, working in many different teams, and often with the advice of visiting entrepreneurs, VCs, domain experts, and other practitioners.
 
Over the course of the semester, students invent and explore hundreds of startup ideas, and learn how to help each other evaluate and improve those ideas.

By the end of the practicum, students self-organize into co-founding teams around specific startup ideas that they will execute on as their Startup Projects the following semester.

The objectives of the practicum are:
* To help students develop the ability to imagine and recognize startup ideas.
* To broaden studentsâ€™ awareness of market sectors and emerging platforms.
* To teach students how to evaluate and improve ideas.
* To give students experience working in many different teams.
* To help students choose co-founders and startup idea for their Startup Project.
* To encourage students to pursue ambitious, potentially transformative startup opportunities.

Student responsibilities:
* This practicum is a series of interactive working sessions that require the full participation of all students.
* In each session, student teams record their startup ideas in the idea tracker.
* In between sessions, students record additional ideas in the idea tracker.
* As a deliverable for the final session, students must present the teams and startup ideas they plan to execute on as their Startup Projects the following semester, and why they chose those teams and ideas.

Grading:
* In order to earn an A, each student must record at least ten startup ideas in the idea tracker over the course of the semester, either independently or as part of a team. Attendance and participation are required. Students are allowed one unexcused absence.
