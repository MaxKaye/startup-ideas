# Startup Ideas (CS 5092)

This practicum helps students develop their ability to imagine, recognize, develop, and improve startup ideas. 

In each session, students learn a different approach to product ideation or product critique, then practice that approach, working in many different teams, and often with the advice of visiting entrepreneurs, VCs, domain experts, and other practitioners.

Over the course of the semester, students invent and explore hundreds of startup ideas, and help each other evaluate and improve those ideas.

By the end of the practicum, students self-organize into co-founding teams around specific startup ideas that they will execute on in Startup Studio the following semester.

The objectives of the practicum are:

* To help students develop the ability to imagine, recognize, and develop startup ideas
* To teach students how to evaluate and improve ideas
* To broaden studentsâ€™ awareness of emerging platforms, markets, and investment theses
* To give students experience collaborating with many of their peers
